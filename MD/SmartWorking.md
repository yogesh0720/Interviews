**Answer:**
Ensuring code quality and reliability is a fundamental aspect of my development process. I follow a structured approach that includes several best practices:

**1. Test-Driven Development (TDD)**
- Write tests before the actual code
- Ensure functionality meets requirements from the outset

**2. Automated Testing**
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Facilitates easier refactoring and feature additions

**3. Static Analysis Tools**
- Tools like PHPStan and Psalm
- Catch potential issues early in development
- Enforce coding standards and identify vulnerabilities

**4. Code Reviews**
- Active participation in giving and receiving feedback
- Foster culture of continuous improvement
- Ensure adherence to high coding standards

In my previous role at Entrata India, I built event-driven Node.js microservices and implemented comprehensive automated test coverage, which significantly improved system reliability.
