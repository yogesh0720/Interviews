For a 13+ years experienced PHP engineer with a 2-hour interview, you can expect a mix of deep technical, architectural, and scenario-based questions—not just syntax. The interviewer will likely evaluate:

1. Core PHP knowledge (depth & fundamentals)
2. System design & architecture (scalability, maintainability, best practices)
3. Framework experience (e.g., Symfony, Laravel, Zend, Yii)
4. Database design & optimization
5. API design & integration
6. DevOps & cloud (if relevant, like AWS, Docker, CI/CD)
7. Team leadership & mentoring (since you’re senior)
Here’s a structured list of possible questions for a 2-hour round:

1. PHP Core (20–30 mins)
* Explain how PHP handles request lifecycle.
* How does PHP memory management (zval, garbage collection) work?
* Difference between == and === in PHP, and pitfalls.
* How PHP handles sessions internally.
* Error handling strategies (try-catch, error handler, logging).
* Explain spl_autoload_register() and how Composer autoloading works.
* How do generators (yield) improve performance in PHP?
* Difference between interfaces, abstract classes, and traits.

2. Frameworks & OOP Design (20–25 mins)
* How would you design a multi-tenant application in Symfony/Laravel?
* How do you structure service classes, repositories, and controllers?
* What are Dependency Injection containers, and why do frameworks use them?
* Event-driven architecture in PHP frameworks (listeners, subscribers).
* How do you handle middleware pipelines?

3. Database & Performance (20–25 mins)
* How would you optimize a slow SQL query?
* Difference between indexing strategies (BTREE vs HASH).
* How do you handle DB migrations in production?
* How to design a scalable schema for millions of users?
* Connection pooling strategies in PHP (PDO, persistent connections).
* Caching strategies (Redis, Memcached, Doctrine Cache).

4. API Design & System Integration (15–20 mins)
* How do you design a REST API vs GraphQL?
* Best practices for authentication (JWT, OAuth2, API tokens).
* How do you secure APIs against replay attacks, CSRF, XSS?
* Versioning APIs — how to handle breaking changes?
* Example: "How would you build an API that can handle 10k concurrent requests?"

5. Scalability & Architecture (20–25 mins)
* Monolith vs SOA vs Microservices — trade-offs in PHP.
* How do you break a monolith PHP app into services?
* How would you implement event queues in PHP (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka, SQS)?
* Horizontal scaling vs vertical scaling — which works better with PHP?
* How do you handle background jobs in PHP (e.g., Symfony Messenger, Laravel Queues)?

6. DevOps, CI/CD & Cloud (15–20 mins)
* How do you containerize a PHP app (Docker best practices)?
* PHP with AWS — which services have you used (S3, RDS, ECS, Lambda)?
* CI/CD pipelines for PHP (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins).
* Zero-downtime deployment strategies.
* How to manage secrets & environment configs in production?

7. Leadership & Problem Solving (15–20 mins)
* Tell me about a time you led a PHP migration (e.g., PHP 5 → 8).
* How do you mentor juniors on clean code and best practices?
* How do you manage code reviews in large teams?
* Conflict resolution in technical decisions.
* Example: "Your team is pushing code with too many bugs. How do you handle it?"

✅ Tips for 2-hour format:
* Expect coding + design exercise (like building a mini API or refactoring code).
* Expect system design whiteboard round (e.g., "Design Uber backend in PHP").
* Expect behavioral leadership questions at the end.
